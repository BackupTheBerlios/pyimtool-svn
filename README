PyImtool (http://pyimtool.berlios.de/)
Version 1.0a1


Introduction
    PyImtool is a native Mac OS X IRAF image server. Other examples of
IRAF image servers include well known applications like SAO DS9 and NOAO
Ximtool.
    There are two main differences between PyImtool and its competitors:
on one hand PyImtool is nowhere near as mature as, say, DS9. On the
other hand, though, PyImtool does not require an X11 server. To put it
in another way, PyImtool is a full fledged Cocoa application (and, to
the best of my knowledge, the only Mac OS X native app in its category).
    For those not familiar with DS9 and other IRAF image servers, what
PyImtool does is very simple and very specific. It allows users to
display astronomical data (e.g. images and spectra) from data reduction
and analysis packages like IRAF and PyRAF. It supports the IIS protocol
(also known as Ximtool protocol) for inter-application communications
both via sockets and via UNIX pipes.


Installation
    Installing PyImtool is just as easy as installing any other Mac OS X
app: just drag it anywhere you want on your Mac! Standard locations
include the main /Applications directory or your home directory. Any
other place is fine too.
    To uninstall PyImtool, just drag it in the Trash. It is as simple as
that.


Requirements
    Mac OS X 10.3 (aka Panther) or later. PyImtool might be made to work
under Mac OS X 10.2. Similarly, it might be possible to port PyImtool to
GNUStep. There are no plans to support anything other than 10.3 or later
at the moment.


Usage
    Simply double click on PyImtool. If everything goes well, it will
start up and display its main window. At this you can start an
IRAF/PyRAF session (if you haven't already) and try the standard

cl> display dev$pix 1

    command from the IRAF/PyRAF prompt. If you see an image being
displayed in PyImtool, you are home free. If not... well, there might be
(gasp!) a bug in the code! In that case, please drop me a line on the
pyimtool-dev mailing list
(http://developer.berlios.de/mail/?group_id=1832).


Source Code
    PyImtool comes with the full source code included in the application
itself (just look under PyImtool.app/Contents/Resources). The latest and
greatest version of the source code is available via BerliOS.de
(http://developer.berlios.de/svn/?group_id=1832). In order to check out
a copy of the code, you need SVN installed on your system
(http://subversion.tigris.org/). 
    To build PyImtool from source you need both PyObjC and the Apple
developer tools. The SVN code includes the XCode project files.


Support
     Support is currently limited to our mailing lists on BerliOS.de
(http://developer.berlios.de/mail/?group_id=1832).
